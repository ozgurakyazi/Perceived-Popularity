    <h1>Our Terms of Agreement</h1>
    <br>
    This is a project carried out by students of Bogazici University. The purpose of the project is to study the

    user experience of a social platform for art and evaluate the “like” system of that platform. Your

    participation in the project is voluntary and no information regarding your identity will be kept with the

    exception of your age and your gender. You may take as long as you like on the page, but it should take

    about two minutes on average. You are free to stop any time without finishing. If you have any

    questions, you may contact: <u>hamishdee@gmail.com</u> By entering the website, you are agreeing to these

    terms.

    <br>
    As a reminder, you may vote for any artworks you like and ignore those that you don’t.

    And thank you!
